Therefore, we performed pain phenotyping, functional neuroimaging, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic assessments, inflammation biomarkers, and gene expression profiling in healthy subjects who underwent surgical extraction of bony impacted third molars and were treated with ibuprofen (400 mg; N = 19) or placebo (N = 10). Analgesic efficacy was not associated with demographic or clinical characteristics, ibuprofen pharmacokinetics, or the degree of cyclooxygenase inhibition by ibuprofen. Compared with partial responders to ibuprofen (N = 9, required rescue medication within the dosing interval), complete responders (N = 10, no rescue medication) exhibited greater induction of urinary prostaglandin metabolites and serum tumor necrosis factor‐α and interleukin 8. Differentially expressed genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were enriched for inflammation‐related pathways. These findings suggest that a less pronounced activation of the inflammatory prostanoid system is associated with insufficient pain relief on ibuprofen alone and the need for additional therapeutic intervention.\"\n",

In the present study, we developed stable mouse models of acute drug-induced hepatic injury (DILI) and acute drug-induced hepatic failure (DILF) by sub-lethal and lethal APAP injection respectively. The differences in hepatic transcriptome profiling between these two models were compared by RNA sequencing, which were validated by qPCR, western-blot and ELISA. In results, serum IL-6, TNF-a and IL-10 levels are higher in DILF than in DILI. The upregulated genes in DILF compared with DILI were mostly enriched in the areas of “cellular development process”, “cell division”, “multicellular organism development,” etc. The downregulated genes in DILF compared with DILI were mostly enriched in the areas of “cellular response to chemical stimulus”, “cellular response to stress”, “cell activation,” etc. Sub-lethal doses of APAP increased Myc, Bag3 and Btc expression in mouse liver, but lethal doses of APAP did not, which suggested that these three genes might play important roles in adaptive protection reactions in DILI. The serum Btc level might be a potential biomarker of drug induced liver injury with good prognosis. Our data can help us better understand the mechanisms of hepatotoxicity that influence prognosis and seek novel prognostic indicators of DILI.\"\n",

Its pathogenetic mechanisms are incompletely understood. Additional studies are warranted to identify new genetic risk factors for more mechanistic insights and new therapeutic target discoveries. The objective of this study was to explore the role and mechanisms of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) in acetaminophen-induced ALI. C57BL/6 Nampt gene wild-type (Nampt+/+), heterozygous knockout (Nampt+/-), and overexpression (NamptOE) mice were treated with overdose of acetaminophen, followed by histologic, biochemical, and transcriptomic evaluation of liver injury. The mechanism of Nampt in acetaminophen-induced hepatocytic toxicity was also explored in cultured primary hepatocytes. Three lines of evidence have convergently demonstrated that acetaminophen overdose triggers the most severe oxidative stress and necrosis, and the highest expression of key necrosis driving genes in Nampt+/- mice, whereas the effects in NamptOE mice were least severe relative to Nampt+/+ mice. Treatment of P7C3-A20, a small chemical molecule up-regulator of Nampt, ameliorated acetaminophen-induced mouse ALI over the reagent control. These findings support the fact that NAMPT protects against acetaminophen-induced ALI. \"\n",

    "        \"text\": \"Monocyte-derived macrophages (MoMF) play a pivotal role in the resolution of acetaminophen-induced liver injury (AILI). Timely termination of neutrophil activity and their clearance are essential for liver regeneration following injury. Here, we show that infiltrating Ly6Chi monocytes, their macrophage descendants, and neutrophils spatially and temporally overlap in the centrilobular necrotic areas during the necroinflammatory and resolution phases of AILI. At the necroinflammatory phase, inducible ablation of circulating Ly6Chi monocytes resulted in reduced numbers and fractions of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing neutrophils. In alignment with this, neutrophils sorted from monocyte-deficient livers exhibited reduced expression of NADPH oxidase 2. Moreover, human CD14+ monocytes stimulated with lipopolysaccharide or hepatocyte apoptotic bodies directly induced ROS production by cocultured neutrophils. RNA-seq-based transcriptome profiling of neutrophils from Ly6Chi monocyte-deficient versus normal livers revealed 449 genes that were differentially expressed with at least twofold change (p ≤ 0.05). In the absence of Ly6Chi monocytes, neutrophils displayed gene expression alterations associated with decreased innate immune activity and increased cell survival. At the early resolution phase, Ly6Chi monocytes differentiated into ephemeral Ly6Clo MoMF and their absence resulted in significant accumulation of late apoptotic neutrophils. Further gene expression analysis revealed the induced expression of a specific repertoire of bridging molecules and receptors involved with apoptotic cell clearance during the transition from Ly6Chi monocytes to MoMF. Collectively, our findings establish a phase-dependent task division between liver-infiltrating Ly6Chi monocytes and their MoMF descendants with the former regulating innate immune functions and cell survival of neutrophils and the later neutrophil clearance. \"\n",
